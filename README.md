To do:

Evaluation

Start with one activity A in isolation (walk, stand, up/down stairs, sit, ironing/brush teeth)

Train on  A plus ? (all other activities, maybe no other activities, maybe a smaller set)

Repeat for every occurrence of A in the test dataset

Remove all but that occurrence in the dataset

Remove similar activities (for walk these would be NordicWalking, Running)

Label all other activities as non-A

Evaluate with metrics

Aggregated datasets (PAMAP2, UCI-HAR, Capture24)

GSUR datasets, aggregate labeled instances

Compare with baselines

Report per activity, per dataset, global across activities and datasets
